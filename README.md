# Sudoku Solver
This is a small Python project that uses a simple backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.

## Usage
Run either the `main.py` or `GUI.py` files through an interpreter to solve the puzzle.

The GUI version displays the recursion in realtime visually using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/). Many thanks to (techwithtim)[https://github.com/techwithtim] who initially designed the GUI, which I then modified.
